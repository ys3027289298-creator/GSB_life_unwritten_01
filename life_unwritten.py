📖 Chapter 1: Reflection

{self.state.player_name}, you find yourself at a crossroads in life. 
Looking back, you realize that some of your most important relationships 
have grown distant due to choices you've made - or failed to make.

Your phone sits on the table with several unread messages. Your calendar 
shows missed family events. The weight of disconnection sits heavy on 
your shoulders.

But today feels different. Today, you have the chance to reconnect, 
to rebuild, and to rediscover what truly matters.

The question is: where do you begin?
